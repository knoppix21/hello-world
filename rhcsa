Redirecting and error output.

:# asdfsdfds 2> badcommand.txt		# 2 standard error

:# asdfsdfds 2> /dev/null		# is kind of a kernel location for empty information, info is lost.

./command &> output.out		# Redirect the standard error and standard output to a file.

:# sdfsdfsdfsd 2>&1		# Redirects the standard error to standard output


## Use grep and Regular Expressions to Analyze Text:

grep '^#' /etc/ssh/sshd_config		# Search first # on the file sshd_config

grep -i # non case sensitive
grep -v # select do not much with the patters
grep 'world$' # matches the words that on the end of the line
grep [lL]inuxacademy file # matches lower or upper letter "l/L"
grep '[^linux]' # negate or do not much.

# Basic regex

grep -E '(a)+' file		# -E means extended regex, "+" means matching 1 or more times.
grep 'l...x' file

note: check other tut for regex
